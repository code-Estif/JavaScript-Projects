# My JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository is my daily log while learning **JavaScript**.  
Each day, I create a folder with the code I practiced + a README.md explaining what I learned.  
Goal: Commit every single day 

---

## Daily Progress
- Learned how to use `prompt()`, `alert()` and `Number()`.
- Built a **popup calculator** for `+ - * /`.
- Built an **in-page calculator** using `<input>` fields and buttons.

- Practiced `if / else if / else`.
- Learned ternary operator `? :`.
- Wrote examples: voting age check, even/odd check.
- practiced loop > while and for
- build number range tool
- build multiplication number generator
- build math fromula coverter with function and an array
- practice function with array and loop together
- build to-do list pages
- build shoping cart simulation with function and arrays...
- used array methods and function together for big projects
- build question and answet FAQ toggle with JS
- learned objects with method and some of simple concepts like constructor, prototype...
- build Reclipe card with constructor function and 'this' methods...

## Goal
- Learn JavaScript deeply (step by step).

My JavaScript Learning Journey

Hi! I’m Estif, a frontend web developer learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This repository is my daily JavaScript log, with small projects, exercises, and notes about what I learn every day.

 About This Repo:-

Each day has a folder with the code I practiced.
Every project is committed daily to track progress.
Focus is on real projects that a normal user can use, not just developer experiments.
Goal: Learn deeply, practice daily, and build projects once basics are solid.

 What I’ve Learned So Far:-

Basic JavaScript
prompt(), alert(), Number()
Arithmetic operators: + - * / % **
Increment ++ / Decrement --
Comparison operators: == != > < >= <=
Conditional statements: if / else if / else, ternary ? :
Loops: while, for
Functions & Arrays
Function declaration, expression, arrow functions
Callbacks
Arrays (basic + methods): push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice, includes, indexOf, map, filter, find, reduce
Combining arrays, loops, and functions
Objects & OOP
Objects with properties and methods
Constructor functions + this
Prototype methods
Classes + static methods

 Projects I Built:-


Calculators
Popup calculator using prompt()
In-page calculator with <input> and buttons
Supports all operators (+ - * / % **)
Number Tools
Number range tool
Multiplication table generator
Math formula converter with arrays and functions
Task & List Management
To-do list pages
Shopping cart simulatio
Daily Task Reminder App (class + static method)
Interactive & UI Features
FAQ toggle questions/answers
Recipe card using constructor and this
Learning Projects with Arrays & Functions
Projects combining arrays, loops, functions, and object methods
All projects are designed for real users, not just developers, and aim to show practical use of JavaScript.

 Goals

Learn JavaScript deeply, step by step
Commit every day to track progress
Build practical, user-friendly projects
Improve front-end skills with HTML, CSS, and JS

# 🚀 My JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository is my daily log while learning **JavaScript**.  
Each day, I create a folder with the code I practiced + a README.md explaining what I learned.  
Goal: Commit every single day ✅

---

## 📅 Daily Progress
- Learned how to use `prompt()`, `alert()` and `Number()`.
- Built a **popup calculator** for `+ - * /`.
- Built an **in-page calculator** using `<input>` fields and buttons.
- Learned basic operators: `+ - * / % **`.
- Built a **calculator in the browser page** supporting all these operators.
- Practiced increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`).
- Learned comparison operators: `== != > < >= <=`.
- Practiced `if / else if / else`.
- Learned ternary operator `? :`.
- Wrote examples: voting age check, even/odd check.

## 🎯 Goal
- Learn JavaScript deeply (step by step).
- Commit **every day** to track progress.
- Build projects once basics are solid.

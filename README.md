My JavaScript Learning Journey (Completed 100%)

Hi! I’m **Estif**, a self-taught front-end web developer from Ethiopia.  
This repository documents my **JavaScript journey** — building projects every single day from zero.

 About This Repo
- Every day has a folder with a new mini-project I built while learning.
- Each commit represents my daily practice — real progress, not tutorials.
- Focused on **real-world apps** users can actually interact with.
- Goal: Learn deeply, code daily, and build practical projects — not just exercises.

 What I Learned

JavaScript Core
- Variables, constants, data types, and scope  
- Type conversion, arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators  
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`, ternary)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `for...of`)  
- Functions — declarations, expressions, and arrow functions  
- Callback functions and higher-order functions  

 Arrays & Objects
- Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `forEach`, `slice`, `splice`, `includes`, etc.  
- Spread & rest operators  
- Nested and array of objects  
- Sorting, shuffling, and combining data  

 OOP & Advanced Concepts
- Object constructors, prototypes, and `this`  
- Classes, inheritance, static methods, getters/setters  
- Closures, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`  
- Promises, async/await, fetch API  
- JSON handling and error control  
- DOM manipulation, event handling (mouse/keyboard), and dynamic UI

 Projects I Built

 🧮 Calculators & Tools
- Popup calculator using `prompt()`  
- On-page calculator with inputs and buttons  
- Number range tool and table generator  
- Math formula converter and random number utilities  

### User Apps
- To-do list and daily task reminder  
- Shopping cart with validation and totals  
- Smart Budget Splitter (multi-user expense calculator)  
- Habit Tracker (progress bar and localStorage saving)

 Interactive UIs
- Movie Mood Picker  
- Dream Vacation Builder  
- Pixel Painter (draw with color picker)  
- Catch the Box (keyboard + mouse game)

 Dynamic & Async Projects
- Weather app using `fetch()` and JSON  
- Random quote generator  
- Live digital clock and stopwatch  

 My Goals
- Learn JavaScript deeply — done 
- Build real, useful apps from scratch 
- Strengthen front-end skills with clean UI and responsive design  
- **Next:** Master React.js and start freelancing projects

 Next Step
I’ve now completed 100% of JavaScript fundamentals.  
Next, I'll be focusing on mastering javascript.
then, I’ll begin **React** to build larger, smarter apps —  
and start freelancing to turn my skills into real work.
